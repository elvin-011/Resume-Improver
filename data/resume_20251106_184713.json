    "weaknesses": [
      "Conflicting and Future-Dated Timelines: The 'AI Intern Oct 2025 - Present' start date, combined with a BTech completion in April 2025, creates a significant timeline inconsistency. This makes the resume appear future-dated or inaccurate, which can be highly confusing and detrimental to a recruiter.",
      "Incomplete Project Description: The description for the 'Multi-Tool Research Assistant System' project is abruptly cut off ('The pipeline is capable of processing academic pa'), leaving a crucial section unfinished and preventing the reader from fully understanding the project's scope, complexity, and impact.",
      "Lack of Quantifiable Impact: While the experience bullet points describe responsibilities and technologies used, they lack specific, measurable outcomes or achievements. Without numbers or percentages, it's difficult to gauge the candidate's actual contribution, success, and value.",
      "Ambiguous Technology Reference ('Google ADK'): The term 'Google ADK' is used twice without clarification. It is not a standard, universally recognized Google AI SDK or platform name, which can create confusion for recruiters unfamiliar with a potentially internal or proprietary tool.",
      "Premature 'Recent Graduate' Claim: The summary states 'Recent Computer Science graduate' while the BTech is slated for April 2025. This phrasing is misleading if the resume is being used significantly before April 2025, as the candidate is still a student, not a recent graduate."
    ],
    "tips": [
      "Rectify All Dates and Timelines: Immediately correct the 'AI Intern' start date to reflect actual experience. If the internship is prospective or yet to begin, clearly mark it as such (e.g., 'Prospective AI Intern starting Oct 2025') or consider moving it to a 'Future Experience' section until it officially commences. Ensure all dates align logically.",
      "Complete and Elaborate on Projects: Crucially, complete the 'Multi-Tool Research Assistant System' project description. For all projects, elaborate on the problem addressed, methodologies used, specific technologies implemented, and, most importantly, the quantifiable outcomes or impact achieved (e.g., 'achieved X accuracy,' 'processed Y amount of data').",
      "Integrate Quantifiable Achievements: Revise all experience and project bullet points to include specific metrics, percentages, or numerical results. For example, instead of 'Developed an AI-powered travel agent bot,' consider 'Developed an AI-powered travel agent bot, increasing user engagement by X% and reducing query resolution time by Y%.'",
      "Clarify Ambiguous Terminology: Replace or clearly define 'Google ADK' with the actual, recognized Google AI SDK, specific Google Cloud AI service, or other precise technology used. If it's a proprietary internal tool, briefly explain its function or purpose.",
      "Refine Summary for Clarity and Impact: Update the summary to accurately reflect your current academic status (e.g., 'Final-year Computer Science student specializing in AI/ML' or 'Aspiring AI/ML Engineer graduating in April 2025'). Tailor it to specific job types you're seeking and highlight your unique value proposition and career aspirations."

    "score": 4,
    "summary": "Elvin is an aspiring AI/ML engineer, currently completing a BTech in Computer Science with a specialization in AI/ML, and actively pursuing advanced skills in Generative and Agentic AI. The profile showcases a strong technical foundation, practical experience through an internship, and relevant projects in areas like computer vision, NLP, and multi-agent systems. However, the resume is significantly hampered by critical errors, including inconsistent and future-dated timelines, an incomplete project description, and a general lack of quantifiable achievements, which detract from its professionalism and clarity. With careful revision, Elvin's strong technical background could shine through more effectively."
