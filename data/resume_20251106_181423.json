    "weaknesses": [
      "Critical Date Inaccuracy: The 'AI Intern' role lists an impossible future date ('Oct 2025 - Present'), which is a significant red flag and immediately raises doubts about the resume's accuracy. The 'Master's Diploma' also lacks a start date.",
      "Incomplete Information: The description for the 'Multi-Tool Research Assistant System' project is abruptly cut off mid-sentence, leaving crucial details missing and making the project appear unfinished or poorly documented.",
      "Lack of Quantification: While technical skills are strong, the experience and project descriptions largely lack quantifiable achievements or impact (e.g., 'improved efficiency by X%', 'processed Y data points', 'served Z users'). This makes it harder to assess the true value and scale of their contributions.",
      "Generic Summary: The 'SUMMARY' section is somewhat generic ('strong foundation', 'hands-on experience') and doesn't immediately differentiate the candidate or highlight specific, impressive achievements or career aspirations, thus lacking a strong hook.",
      "GPA Context: The BTech GPA of 3.34 is provided, but without context (e.g., out of 4.0 or 10.0), its impact might be unclear to recruiters unfamiliar with the specific grading scale."
    ],
    "tips": [
      "Rectify All Dates Immediately: Correct the 'AI Intern' dates to reflect actual past or present employment. Add a clear start date for the 'Master\u2019s Diploma in Generative AI and Agentic AI' to provide a complete timeline.",
      "Complete & Quantify Project/Experience Descriptions: Ensure all project descriptions are fully elaborated. For both experience and projects, incorporate specific metrics, results, and the impact of your work (e.g., 'Developed an AI-powered travel agent bot that increased user engagement by X% and reduced manual query processing by Y%').",
      "Strengthen the Summary Section: Make the summary more specific, achievement-oriented, and tailored to the types of roles you're seeking. Start with a strong hook that highlights a key unique skill or a major accomplishment.",
      "Clarify 'Master's Diploma': Provide more detail on the 'Master's Diploma in Generative AI and Agentic AI'. Specify if it's a full Master's degree, a postgraduate diploma, or a specialized certificate program to avoid ambiguity.",
      "Tailor and Prioritize Skills: While comprehensive, consider tailoring the skills section slightly for specific job applications, moving the most relevant skills to the top. Also, clarify your GPA context (e.g., '3.34/4.0 GPA')."
