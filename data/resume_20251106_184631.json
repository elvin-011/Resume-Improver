    "weaknesses": [
      "Critical Date Inaccuracy: The 'AI Intern' experience is listed with dates 'Oct 2025 - Present', which is in the future. This is a severe error and an immediate red flag for recruiters.",
      "Lack of Quantification & Impact: Bullet points under 'EXPERIENCE' and 'PROJECTS' describe actions taken but lack specific, measurable results or the business/technical impact of the work (e.g., 'improved accuracy by X%', 'reduced processing time by Y%').",
      "Incomplete Information: The description for the 'Multi-Tool Research Assistant System' project is abruptly cut off, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding of the project's scope and achievements.",
      "Generic Summary: The 'SUMMARY' section is somewhat generic, stating 'strong foundation' and 'hands-on experience' without immediately highlighting unique achievements, specific career goals, or the most impressive skills/experiences.",
      "Dense Skills Section: While comprehensive, the 'SKILLS' section is quite dense and could benefit from better organization or strategic highlighting of the most pertinent skills for target roles, making it easier for recruiters to quickly scan."
    ],
    "tips": [
      "Rectify All Dates Immediately: Correct the 'AI Intern' dates to reflect actual past or current employment. Ensure all dates across the resume (especially for education and experience) are accurate and consistent.",
      "Quantify Achievements with Metrics: For every bullet point under 'EXPERIENCE' and 'PROJECTS', add specific numbers, percentages, or concrete outcomes to demonstrate the impact of your work (e.g., 'Developed an AI-powered travel agent bot, increasing user engagement by 15%').",
      "Complete All Descriptions: Ensure the 'Multi-Tool Research Assistant System' project description is fully written out, providing a complete picture of its functionality, technologies used, and your specific contributions/achievements.",
      "Tailor and Strengthen Summary: Make the summary more impactful by explicitly stating your target role/industry and highlighting 2-3 of your most relevant and impressive accomplishments or unique selling points. For example, 'Highly motivated Computer Science graduate specializing in Generative AI and Computer Vision, seeking to leverage advanced machine learning skills to develop innovative solutions in [Target Industry/Role].'",
      "Refine Skills Presentation: Consider grouping skills more strategically (e.g., 'Core AI/ML', 'Programming Languages', 'Cloud Platforms', 'Tools & Deployment'). Prioritize the most relevant skills for your desired roles at the top of each category to improve readability and emphasize your strengths."
