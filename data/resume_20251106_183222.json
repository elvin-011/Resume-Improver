    "weaknesses": [
      "**Conflicting & Misleading Timelines:** The most critical weakness is the \"AI Intern Oct 2025 - Present\" role listed as current experience while the BTech degree finishes in April 2025. This creates significant confusion about the candidate's current status and honesty.",
      "**Incomplete Project Description:** The description for \"Multi-Tool Research Assistant System\" is cut off mid-sentence, making the resume appear unprofessional and unfinished.",
      "**Lack of Quantifiable Achievements:** While bullet points describe responsibilities, they lack specific metrics or results (e.g., \"improved efficiency by X%\", \"reduced processing time by Y%\") to demonstrate impact for both the internship and projects.",
      "**Ambiguous \"Master's Diploma\" Title:** Presenting a \"Master's Diploma\" alongside a BTech without clarifying its nature (e.g., duration, accreditation, equivalency to a Master's degree) can be confusing and potentially misleading to recruiters.",
      "**Unsubstantiated Claims in Summary:** The claim of \"hands-on experience developing production-ready computer vision, and NLP systems\" is very strong for a candidate whose only listed experience is an internship that hasn't started yet and student projects. It needs stronger evidence."
    ],
    "tips": [
      "**Rectify Timelines and Clarify Current Status:** Immediately correct the dates for the \"AI Intern\" role. If it's a future internship, explicitly state \"Upcoming Internship\" or \"Future Role (Starting Oct 2025)\". If the candidate is currently seeking employment, the resume must accurately reflect their present situation (e.g., \"Expected Graduation: April 2025\").",
      "**Complete All Information:** Ensure all project descriptions, especially \"Multi-Tool Research Assistant System,\" are fully written out and grammatically correct. Proofread the entire resume meticulously for any other cut-off text or typos.",
      "**Quantify Impact with Metrics:** For the internship and projects, revise bullet points to include specific achievements and quantifiable results. Instead of just describing tasks, focus on the *impact* of those tasks (e.g., \"Developed bot that processed X requests/day,\" \"Improved recommendation accuracy by Y%\").",
      "**Clarify \"Master's Diploma\":** Provide more context for the \"Master\u2019s Diploma in Generative AI and Agentic AI.\" Specify its duration, what kind of certification it is, and if it's a postgraduate program, to avoid confusion with a traditional Master's degree.",
      "**Strengthen Summary and Back Claims:** Rephrase the summary to be more aligned with the candidate's actual experience. If \"production-ready\" systems were developed in projects, briefly mention the scale or environment. Consider softening strong claims if they cannot be directly substantiated by the listed experience."

    "score": 4,
    "summary": "Elvin Davis is a Computer Science student specializing in AI/ML, with an expected BTech graduation in April 2025. The candidate possesses a strong skill set in AI/ML frameworks, NLP, computer vision, and is actively pursuing further education in Generative AI and Agentic AI. The profile includes relevant project work demonstrating practical application of these skills. However, the resume suffers from critical timeline inconsistencies, an incomplete project description, and a lack of quantifiable achievements, which significantly hinder its effectiveness and credibility. With crucial corrections, the resume has strong potential."
