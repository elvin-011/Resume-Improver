    "weaknesses": [
      "Critical Date Inconsistencies: The BTech end date (April 2025) conflicts with the AI Intern start date (Oct 2025 - Present), which is a major error that undermines credibility and makes the timeline illogical.",
      "Incomplete Project Description: The description for the \"Multi-Tool Research Assistant System\" is cut off mid-sentence, making the resume appear unprofessional and leaving a key project unexplained.",
      "Vague Education Entry: The title \"Master\u2019s Diploma in Generative AI and Agentic AI\" is unusual and needs clarification (e.g., Postgraduate Diploma, Certificate). Also, \"Current\" for the start/end date is not specific enough.",
      "Lack of Quantifiable Impact: While the experience and project descriptions are clear, they largely lack specific metrics, numbers, or quantifiable achievements to demonstrate the scale or impact of the work.",
      "Generic Summary: The summary provides a good overview but could be more impactful by briefly mentioning a key achievement or a specific type of problem solved, rather than just stating \"hands-on experience.\""
    ],
    "tips": [
      "Correct All Date Inconsistencies: Immediately review and rectify all dates, especially the BTech completion date and the AI Intern start/end dates, to ensure a logical, accurate, and trustworthy professional timeline.",
      "Complete and Proofread All Sections: Ensure all project descriptions are fully written, grammatically correct, and thoroughly proofread. Double-check for any cut-off sentences or typos throughout the entire resume.",
      "Clarify Education and Dates: Rename \"Master\u2019s Diploma\" to a more standard and accurate title (e.g., \"Postgraduate Diploma in Generative AI\"). Provide specific start and anticipated end dates (e.g., \"October 2024 - June 2025\") for the Generative AI program.",
      "Quantify Achievements with Metrics: Enhance bullet points under Experience and Projects by incorporating numbers, percentages, or specific outcomes (e.g., \"Developed X that improved Y by Z%,\" \"Processed over N datasets\").",
      "Strengthen the Summary: Refine the summary to be more dynamic. Consider starting with a compelling achievement or a specific niche skill that immediately grabs attention and aligns with target roles."
