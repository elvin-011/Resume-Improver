    "weaknesses": [
      "Critical Date Inconsistencies: The internship start date (Oct 2025) is in the future and directly contradicts the \"Recent Computer Science graduate\" statement, especially as the BTech also ends in April 2025. This creates significant confusion and raises red flags for recruiters.",
      "Incomplete Sections & Formatting Errors: Both the \"PROJECTS\" section and potentially the \"EXPERIENCE\" (implied by the future date) are cut off or incomplete. The \"Master's Diploma\" entry also lacks a start date, making the resume appear unprofessional and hindering full comprehension.",
      "Lack of Quantifiable Impact: The bullet points under \"EXPERIENCE\" are descriptive but lack specific metrics, numbers, or results that demonstrate the scale, success, or business impact of the candidate's contributions.",
      "Vague Summary Statement: The \"Recent Computer Science graduate\" statement is misleading given the BTech completion in April 2025 and the internship starting in Oct 2025. It needs to accurately reflect the candidate's current academic and professional status.",
      "Ambiguous \"Master's Diploma\": The \"Current\" status for the diploma is vague. It's unclear if this is a full-fledged Master's degree, a postgraduate certificate, or a specialized course, and when it started or is expected to finish."
    ],
    "tips": [
      "Rectify All Date Inconsistencies & Errors: Immediately correct the internship dates to reflect actual past or present engagement. Clarify the graduation status \u2013 if still studying, state \"Expected Graduation: April 2025.\" Ensure all dates across education and experience are logical and accurate.",
      "Complete All Sections & Proofread Thoroughly: Ensure no sections are cut off (especially \"PROJECTS\"). Proofread the entire resume meticulously for any grammatical errors, typos, or incomplete sentences. This includes adding a start date for the Master's Diploma.",
      "Quantify Achievements with Metrics: For each bullet point under \"EXPERIENCE\" and \"PROJECTS,\" incorporate specific numbers, percentages, or metrics to showcase the impact and scale of your work (e.g., \"Developed an AI bot that processed X requests per day,\" \"Reduced manual processing time by Y%,\" \"Improved model accuracy by Z%\").",
      "Refine the Summary Statement: Rewrite the summary to accurately reflect your current academic status and career goals. If still a student, state \"Anticipated Computer Science Graduate\" or \"Currently pursuing BTech... and Master's Diploma...\". Clearly articulate your target role and value proposition.",
      "Clarify \"Master's Diploma\": Provide more details about the \"Master's Diploma\" \u2013 start date, expected completion, and clarify its nature (e.g., \"Postgraduate Diploma,\" \"Advanced Certificate\"). If it's a short-term course, consider moving it under a \"Certifications\" section to avoid confusion with a full Master's degree."
