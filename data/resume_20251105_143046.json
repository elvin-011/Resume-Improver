  "ai_analysis": {
    "weaknesses": [
      "Critical Date Inaccuracy: The 'AI Intern' experience is listed with a start date in the future (Oct 2025), making the resume appear untruthful or carelessly prepared. This is a major red flag for recruiters.",
      "Incomplete Project Description: The description for the 'Multi-Tool Research Assistant System' project is abruptly cut off, leaving a significant section of the resume unfinished and unprofessional.",
      "Lack of Quantifiable Impact: While technically sound, the experience and project descriptions lack specific metrics or quantifiable achievements (e.g., 'improved efficiency by X%', 'processed Y data points', 'reached Z users').",
      "Vague 'Master's Diploma' Entry: The 'Master\u2019s Diploma in Generative AI and Agentic AI' lacks a start date and the full, official name of the program, which can create confusion about its nature (e.g., a full master's degree vs. a professional certificate/diploma).",
      "Generic Summary: The summary is quite broad and doesn't explicitly state the candidate's career goals or the specific types of roles they are targeting, which could make it less impactful for tailored applications."
    ],
    "tips": [
      "Rectify Critical Date Error Immediately: Correct the 'AI Intern' start date to reflect the actual period of employment. This is paramount as a future date for current employment is an instant disqualifier for most recruiters.",
      "Complete All Sections Thoroughly: Ensure the 'PROJECTS' section is fully completed and all descriptions are coherent and comprehensive. Proofread the entire resume meticulously for any other incomplete sentences, typos, or formatting issues.",
      "Incorporate Quantifiable Achievements: For both experience and projects, rephrase bullet points to include numbers, percentages, or specific outcomes. For example, instead of 'Developed an AI-powered travel agent bot,' consider 'Developed an AI-powered travel agent bot, increasing user engagement by X% and processing Y recommendations daily.'",
      "Clarify Educational Entries: Provide the full, official name of the 'Master\u2019s Diploma' program and include its start date (and expected end date if applicable). If it's a diploma and not a master's degree, ensure the title accurately reflects that to avoid misrepresentation.",
      "Tailor Summary and Skills: Customize the 'SUMMARY' to align with the specific job description being applied for, highlighting relevant skills and career aspirations. Consider prioritizing skills within the 'SKILLS' section based on relevance to the target role."
