    "weaknesses": [
      "Conflicting and Incorrect Dates: The 'AI Intern' role is listed with a start date in the future (Oct 2025), and the BTech graduation is April 2025, making the 'Recent Computer Science graduate' claim in the summary inaccurate for a resume being reviewed now. The 'Master's Diploma' is listed as 'Current' without clear dates, creating confusion about its timeline relative to the BTech.",
      "Incomplete Project Description: The description for the 'Multi-Tool Research Assistant System' project is cut off, ending abruptly with 'The pipeline is capable of processing academic pa', which appears unprofessional and leaves the reader uninformed.",
      "Lack of Quantifiable Achievements: While the experience and project descriptions outline responsibilities and technologies used, they largely lack specific metrics or quantifiable outcomes (e.g., 'improved accuracy by X%', 'reduced processing time by Y%', 'handled Z number of requests'). This makes it difficult to assess the impact of the work.",
      "Ambiguous Current Status: The resume struggles to clearly define the candidate's current academic and professional status. Phrases like 'Recent Computer Science graduate' contradict the April 2025 BTech completion, and the future internship date further muddies the waters."
    ],
    "tips": [
      "Correct and Clarify All Dates: This is the most critical fix. Ensure all dates (education, experience) are accurate and reflect the candidate's true timeline. If the internship is prospective or planned, clearly label it as such (e.g., 'Prospective AI Intern' or move it to a 'Planned Experience' section). Clarify the start and end dates for the Master's Diploma, especially its relation to the BTech.",
      "Complete and Enhance Project Descriptions: Fix the cut-off project description immediately. For all projects and experience points, add quantifiable results wherever possible. Use action verbs and focus on the impact and value delivered (e.g., 'Developed X, leading to Y% improvement in Z' or 'Processed N datasets, achieving M accuracy').",
      "Tailor the Summary to Current Status: Update the summary to accurately reflect the candidate's current status. If still a student, state 'Final-year Computer Science student' or 'Graduating in April 2025'. Highlight the strongest relevant skills and career aspirations clearly.",
      "Elaborate on Master's Diploma Context: Provide more context for the 'Master\u2019s Diploma in Generative AI and Agentic AI'. Is it a short-term certification, a full-fledged master's degree, or a specialized program? Clarify its duration and how it fits into the overall academic timeline.",
      "Proofread Meticulously: Beyond the major errors, conduct a thorough proofread for any typos, grammatical errors, or formatting inconsistencies. These small details contribute significantly to a professional impression."
    ],
    "score": 4,
    "summary": "Elvin Davis is a final-year Computer Science student specializing in AI/ML, with a strong foundation in computer vision and NLP. The candidate demonstrates proficiency in various AI/ML frameworks, programming languages, and cloud platforms, complemented by hands-on project experience, including work with Generative AI and multi-agent systems. While the technical skills and project work are promising, the resume is significantly hampered by critical errors related to conflicting dates, an incomplete project description, and an unclear current status, which would hinder immediate consideration."
