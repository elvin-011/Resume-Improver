    "weaknesses": [
      "**Major Chronological Inconsistencies/Typos:** The BTech graduation date (April 2025) and the AI Intern start date (Oct 2025 - Present) create a confusing and likely incorrect timeline, severely impacting credibility.",
      "**Incomplete Project Description:** The description for the 'Multi-Tool Research Assistant System' project is abruptly cut off ('The pipeline is capable of processing academic pa'), making the resume appear unfinished and unprofessional.",
      "**Lack of Quantifiable Achievements:** While the experience and projects describe *what* was done, they largely lack specific metrics or quantifiable results (e.g., 'increased efficiency by X%', 'improved accuracy by Y%'), making it hard to gauge impact.",
      "**Vague Education Dates/Program Title:** The 'Master\u2019s Diploma in Generative AI and Agentic AI, Boston Institute of Analytics Current' lacks specific start/end dates and the term 'Master's Diploma' could be clarified (e.g., Post-Graduate Diploma, Certificate Program) to avoid ambiguity.",
      "**Ambiguous Technology Acronym:** 'Google ADK' is mentioned twice but not fully specified. It's likely Google AI SDK, but it should be explicitly written out for clarity to avoid confusion for recruiters."
    ],
    "tips": [
      "**Correct All Dates and Complete Information:** Immediately rectify the internship dates to ensure they are accurate and chronological. Crucially, complete the 'Multi-Tool Research Assistant System' project description and add specific start/end dates to the Master's Diploma.",
      "**Quantify Achievements with Metrics:** For both the internship and projects, integrate specific metrics and results to demonstrate impact. For example, 'Developed an AI-powered travel agent bot, *increasing user engagement by X%*,' or 'Engineered an agentic workflow that *improved recommendation accuracy by Y%*.'",
      "**Elaborate on Education/Certification:** For the 'Master's Diploma,' specify if it's a full-time, part-time, or a certificate program, and provide clear start/end dates (or expected completion date if ongoing) to enhance clarity.",
      "**Standardize Technology Names:** Fully spell out acronyms the first time they are used (e.g., 'Google AI SDK (ADK)') or consistently use the full name to ensure no ambiguity for the reader.",
      "**Tailor Summary for Target Roles & Strengthen Action Verbs:** Customize the summary to target specific roles (e.g., 'seeking AI/ML Engineer roles focused on Generative AI...'). Also, ensure all bullet points start with strong action verbs that highlight achievements."

    "score": 6,
    "summary": "Elvin Davis is a technically proficient Computer Science graduate specializing in AI/ML, with a strong emphasis on Generative AI, Agentic AI, Computer Vision, and NLP. The candidate demonstrates practical experience through an AI internship and significant projects, showcasing skills in developing complex AI systems and workflow orchestration using modern frameworks and tools. Despite a solid technical foundation and relevant skill set for AI/ML roles, the resume is significantly hampered by critical errors such as chronological inconsistencies, an incomplete project description, and a lack of quantifiable achievements, which detract from its professionalism and clarity."
